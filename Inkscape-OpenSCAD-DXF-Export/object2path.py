Converts objects to paths

The extension converts all objects in the current layer into paths

To convert objects to paths, Inkscape itself is called from within this
extension, using the ``--verb`` hack provided by the ``inkinkex`` module. The
restrictions of the ``inkinkex`` module are inherited by this extension.
